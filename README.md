##Getting Started

Now, before we get started, let me be clear that there is a slight barrier of entry to the project that may detract some, and that barrier is that the project uses [Lilypond](http://www.lilypond.org/), a free &amp; open source program that compiles Lilypond markup syntax into sheet music. Now don't be dismayed! If you have ever used HTML, you are familiar with markup languages. I recommend going through Lilypond's [basic tutorial](http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/learning/tutorial) to learn how to create a basic song.

##Contributing to theditty.ly

Contributing to The Ditty is remarkably simple. If you are familiar with Git, it's even easier! Put simply, the goal is to download a file, edit it on your own computer, and when you save it, the website updates to reflect your changes.

Now, clearly it cannot be *that* easy, because how would the website know when you saved it on your computer? To address this we use the GitHub software for [Windows](https://windows.github.com/) or [Mac](https://mac.github.com/).

###How do I use GitHub with The Ditty?

1. First create a GitHub account.
2. Make sure you have a copy of the GitHub software installed for [Windows](https://windows.github.com/) or [Mac](https://mac.github.com/).
2. Submit an [issue ticket](https://github.com/joey-di-nardo/the-ditty/issues) with a request to be added as a "collaborator". You will shortly be granted access to directly contribute to The Ditty.
3. Go back to the main [The Ditty](https://github.com/joey-di-nardo/the-ditty) GitHub page, make sure the "branch" says "gh-pages" and click "Clone in Desktop" on the right side of the page. This will create a monitored copy of the repository wherever you decide on your local computer and monitor it for changes.
4. You're ready to edit! Edit theditty.ly (making sure to keep it in the same folder as when you downloaded) however you wish, generate a pdf of your output (making sure to keep it in the same folder as when you downloaded) and then use the GitHub app to "commit, push, and sync" the changes back into the repository.

Check the website, the most current version pushed is the one displayed :sparkles:.

##License and Copyright

Because the Ditty is realized as code, the Ditty as a "musical work" may be considered code as such and falls under the MIT license outlined within the repo.
